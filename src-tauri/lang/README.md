# Translating reMITM

- Fork this repository
- Create a new file in the `src-tauri/lang` folder with the name of your language (e.g. `lang/jp.json` for Japanese)
  - You can also copy an existing file and edit it instead, which is probably easier.
- Fill in the `language` field with the names of the language. If the language uses non-english characters, use that name.
- Build using instructions from the main README.md, select the language to test!
- Submit a pull request with your changes
